/// Just like `exercise`, it allocates `count * block_size` number
/// of bytes in memory, but:
///
/// - it doesn't do it all at once as fast as it can, instead, it
///   slowly allocates a new block based on `interval`; and
/// - once it reaches the desired size, it deallocates the memory
///   in chunks as well.
///
/// In summary, memory utilization (working set) should look like:
///
/// ```txt
///  
///  alloc       alloc
///
///
///      .--.     .--.
///   __/    \___/    \__

///        dealloc   dealloc ...
