### chicken-gun 

> A **chicken gun** is a large-diameter, compressed-air cannon used to fire dead chickens at aircraft components in order to simulate high-speed bird strikes during the aircraft's flight. (source: [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_gun))

Here you can find `cg`, a tool aimed at providing very targetted load at specific parts of a machine to verify:

- what happens when specific problematic scenarios occur, and
- if we're properly collecting telemetry from our systems.

Just like in a regular bare-metal or virtual machine, `cg` can run in containerized environments too.

A container image can be found on DockerHub: [cirocosta/chicken-gun](https://hub.docker.com/r/cirocosta/chicken-gun).

```sh
docker run cirocosta/chicken-gun cpu --threads 4
```
